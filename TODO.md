# TODO: Update Website Background and Styling for Elegance and Professionalism

## Information Gathered
- Current background uses animated gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #000011, #000022, #000044) with gradientShift animation.
- Glassmorphism effects use rgba(255,255,255,0.1) for backgrounds.
- Bright gradients like #ff6b6b, #4ecdc4 for highlights and links.
- Multiple pages (index.html, projects.html, etc.) share the same css/style.css.
- Task requires: background #0B192A for all pages, use #0E284F appropriately, make website elegant and professional.

## Plan
- Update body background to solid #0B192A.
- Replace or modify glass backgrounds to use #0E284F with appropriate opacity.
- Tone down bright gradients to more professional blue/gray tones.
- Remove or reduce the animated background gradientShift animation for a static, elegant look.
- Adjust hover effects and transitions to be more subtle and professional.
- Ensure consistency across all pages by updating shared CSS.

## Dependent Files to Edit
- css/style.css: Main stylesheet for all pages.

## Followup Steps
- Open index.html in browser to verify changes.
- Check other pages like projects.html for consistency.
- Adjust if needed for better professionalism.
